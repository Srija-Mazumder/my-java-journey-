Question:
Write a function that accepts three parameters:

Two positive integers r and unit, and
A positive integer array arr of size n.
Parameters:

r: Represents the number of rats present in an area.
unit: The amount of food each rat consumes.
arr: Each element of the array represents the amount of food present in a house, where the index of the array corresponds to the house number.
The function should determine the minimum number of houses required to provide enough food for all the rats.

Constraints:
Return -1 if the array is empty.
Return 0 if the total amount of food from all houses is not sufficient for all the rats.
Computed values lie within the integer range.
Assume the array contains non-negative integers representing the food quantities.
The array length, n, and food units are positive integers.
